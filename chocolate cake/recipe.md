Heat oven to 350Â°F. Line two 8 inch round baking pans with parchment paper and then spray lightly with non-stick cooking spray. Set aside.
Stir together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl. 
Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla and mix until well combined.
Stir in boiling water (or hot coffee). Batter will be thin, but that's okay! Pour batter into prepared pans.

Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean.
